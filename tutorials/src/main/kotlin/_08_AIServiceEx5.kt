        |Our stay at hotel was a mixed experience. The location was perfect, just a stone's throw away 
        |from the beach, which made our daily outings very convenient. The rooms were spacious and well-decorated, 
        |providing a comfortable and pleasant environment. However, we encountered several issues during our 
        |stay. The air conditioning in our room was not functioning properly, making the nights quite uncomfortable. 
        |Additionally, the room service was slow, and we had to call multiple times to get extra towels. Despite the 
        |friendly staff and enjoyable breakfast buffet, these issues significantly impacted our stay.
